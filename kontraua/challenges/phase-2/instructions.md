# Phase-2 Instructions: Deploy ERC20 token smart contract

This guide helps you to deploy an ERC20 token smart contract on [Kontraua testnet](https://regen.wasm.glass/)

Note: This document borrows most of the instructions from [COSMWASM official docs](https://www.cosmwasm.com/docs/getting-started/intro), thanks to **Ethan Frey** and team.

Don't be in a hurry, please read all the instructions before proceeding. We appreciate your time!

## Pre-requisites

### Install Rust

Please feel free to refer [rust basics](https://www.cosmwasm.com/docs/getting-started/rust-basics) for more details.

`rustup` is an installer for the systems programming language [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

Run the following in your terminal, then follow the onscreen instructions.

```
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Once installed, make sure you have the wasm32 target, both on stable and nightly:
```
$ rustup default stable
$ rustup target list --installed
$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

$ rustup install nightly
$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
```

## Download and edit/update the contract

### Get the code

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cosmwasm/cosmwasm-examples
$ cd cosmwasm-examples/erc20
$ git checkout erc20-0.3.0
```

### Compile the wasm contract with stable toolchain
```
rustup default stable
cargo wasm
```
After this compiles, it should produce a file at  `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cw_erc20.wasm`. A quick `ls -l` should show around 1.5MB. This is a release build, but not stripped of all unneeded code

### Compiling for Production
You can check the size of the contract file by running:
```
$ du -h target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cw_erc20.wasm

// Outputs
1.9M    target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cw_erc20.wasm
```
This works, but is huge for a blockchain transaction. Let's try to make it smaller. Turns out there is a linker flag to strip off debug information:

```
$ RUSTFLAGS='-C link-arg=-s' cargo wasm
$ du -h target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cw_erc20.wasm

// Outputs
128K    target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cw_erc20.wasm
```
This is looking much better in size.

Those who wants to experiment with other cool features can try out: [reproduceable builds](https://www.cosmwasm.com/docs/getting-started/editing-escrow-contract#reproduceable-builds)

## Deploy your erc20 contract

All the wasm related commands can be found at:
```
xrncli tx wasm -h
```

And, related queries at: 
```
xrncli query wasm -h
```

NOTE: Please feel free to request tokens in DVD channel if your validator account doesn't have available tokens

### Step - 1 : Upload your contract (Optional)
You can create/upload a new contract code or instantiate an existing code too (You can use https://regen.wasm.glass/codes/5 in case you chose to instantiate contract directly).

To upload a new contract,

```
xrncli tx wasm store contract.wasm --gas auto --from <key_name> --node <rpc_endpoint> -y
```

You can check your code id at (by your account address): https://regen.wasm.glass/codes

For more details about uploading contract, check the details here: https://www.cosmwasm.com/docs/getting-started/first-demo#uploading-the-code

### Step - 2: Instantiating the Contract

Please edit the **INIT** config with your details. You can add as many account address as you wish. Make sure to include your account address as one of the addresses. Naming your token name unique is preferred.

```
# Please make sure to add your address(es) in initial_balances

INIT="{\"decimals\":5,\"name\":\"XRN token\",\"symbol\":\"XRN\",\"initial_balances\":[{\"address\":\"xrn:1tay3xlj0jnl8csnvteky8wc0e3206favkg74ue\",\"amount\":\"1000\"},{\"address\":\"xrn:1ntlzxh9y245htk99gz55gslz3n8lzclexenx9m\",\"amount\":\"2000\"},{\"address\":\"xrn:1vkxgpw4xtyeljzvqnxxy84kpa6udqaqw8leqjg\",\"amount\":\"3000\"}]}"

xrncli tx wasm instantiate <code_id> "$INIT" --from <key_name> --label "ERC20 <moniker>" --node <rpc_endpoint> --chain-id kontraua -y 
```

Verify your code instance:
```
# check the contract state (and account balance)
xrncli query wasm list-contract-by-code <code_id>  --node <rpc_endpoint> --chain-id kontraua

# contracts ids (like code ids) are based on an auto-gen sequence
# if this is the first contract in the devnet, it will have this address (otherwise, use the result from list-contract-by-code)
CONTRACT=xrn:10pyejy66429refv3g35g2t7am0was7ya75d7y2

# query contract to verify init message and balances
xrncli query wasm contract $CONTRACT --node <rpc_endpoint> --chain-id kontraua --trust-node

# you can query contract address as normal account
xrncli query account $CONTRACT --node <rpc_endpoint> --chain-id kontraua --trust-node

# you can dump entire contract state
xrncli query wasm contract-state all $CONTRACT --node <rpc_endpoint> --chain-id kontraua
```

### Step-3: Execute contract functions

Set the transfer msg:
```
TRANSFER_MSG="{\"transfer\": {\"recipient\": \"xrn:1ntlzxh9y245htk99gz55gslz3n8lzclexenx9m\",\"amount\": \"2\"}}"
```

Execute the transfer function 
```
xrncli tx wasm execute $CONTRACT "$TRANSFER_MSG" --from <from_key>
```

**Check balance:**

You need to create a smart query with account address for querying balance:
```
BALANCE_QUERY="{\"balance\": {\"address\": \"xrn:1ntlzxh9y245htk99gz55gslz3n8lzclexenx9m\"}}"
```

Command to query balance is
```
xrncli query wasm  contract-state smart $CONTRACT "$BALANCE_QUERY" --node http://173.255.192.172:26657 --chain-id kontraua -o json
```

## What is expected from validators?

1. Upload erc20 code and Copy the TX HASH
2. Instantiate contract with validator label and copy TX Hash, Contract address
3. Transfer tokens to 5 validators and copy hash
4. Fork testnets repo and clone: githbu.com/regen-network/testnets
5. cd testnets/kontraua/challenges/phase-2/
6. cp sample.json <your_validator_moniker>.json
7. Edit the details
8. Commit the changes to your repo
9. Raise PR with title: "Phase-2: <Validator_moniker>"

## Points criteria
- 100 points for successful deployment (code upload is optional, instance creation is mandatory)
- 100 points for transfering contract tokens (at least 5 transfers)
- 50 points for editing the contract to add any custom feature (send extra tokens than allowed,  hardcode recipient address, send text message, request funds, approve fund request, data storage etc)
- 100 bonus points for creating an allowance and use transferFrom to send tokens from a second address (Instructions for this are not available, as it is a bonus)
- A total of 1000 bonus points are shared among first 20 validators to complete these tasks (Eligibility: min 250 points earnings in phase-2). These rankings will be based on **final (latest) tx time**
  - First 5â€“100 each
  - 6 to 10 : 50 each
  - 11 to 20: 25 each

**Note:** 
- There will be a special bonus of 100 points for each bug/vulnerability reported (non-duplicate), malfunctioning the network.

- All the edited contracts must be deployed using your validator owner account.
