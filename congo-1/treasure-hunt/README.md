# Regen congo-1 festive fun!

## What is it?
A short series of festive-themed challenges, between Thursday 19th December to Monday 23rd December.

## Where is it?
The Regen Validators (DVD) telegram channel.

## What is it for?
There will be a _small_ reward, added to the incentivised testnet balance, for those validators that complete each challenge.

## What are the challenges?
The challenges will be announced daily; close to 1200UTC on the Telegram channel.

The final challenge will be at or around 1200UTC on Monday 23rd December; this specific challenge is first-come, first-served - so only the first response will be accepted!

## What do I have to do?
Each challenge will require you to submit a transaction. The hash of that transaction needs to be added into a PR to this repo (targetted at the `congo-1/treasure-hunt/<validatorname>/` directory - see the sample file submitted by Chorus One, for the challenge 'submit your favourite Christmas food as the memo in binary').
Any PRs and commits that are present at 0000UTC on December 26th will be considered for rewards. 

Results will be published here in the New Year.
