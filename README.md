### [`congo-1`](https://github.com/regen-network/testnets/tree/modifications/archive/congo-1)

`congo-1` was the first community-driven testnet between 7th November 2019 and 17th January 2020, at which point it was abandoned in order to prepare for the next incentivised testnet.

## KYC Utils

### Generate Validator Keys
Linking a validator address to your identity is how we ensure the right validator is rewarded for the hard work of participating in our incentivized testnets.  Please back up your keys and maintain the same keys thorughout testnet operations if possible.  If you have a key management issue, please use the same Moniker in generation of new keys and notify the team.

The same validator keys can be used for different testnets, and even for main net (as long as you practice good key management). 

Here are instructions for generating keys for regen ledger.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/regen-network/testnets
cd testnets
git pull

chmod +x scripts/gen_val_keys.sh
./scripts/gen_val_keys.sh <your_key_name>
```
